# GameLoop

Hello! Everything you need is in the repository, unless you want to run/mess with the ThreeTest (which is by far the most fun one). In that case, you'll need a copy of the three.js files (you can download these at https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/archive/master.zip ). Unzip the archive and put its contents into the js folder, and you're good to go!
